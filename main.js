// 1. How do we assign a value to a variable? 

var dog = 'Arnold'

// 2. How do we change the value of a variable?

// 5. What is pseudocoding and why should you do it?

// qseudocoding is coding a problem in words rather than syntax. It helps because it breaks down large problems into many smaller problems which are often easier to tackle.

// 6. What percentage of time should be spent thinking about how you're going to solve a problem vs actually typing in code to solve it?

// 30% / 70%
